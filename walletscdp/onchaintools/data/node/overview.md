# Welcome to Node

<Info>
  Starting January 2026, the CDP Node API will require developers to have a payment method on file. See [Pricing](/data/node/pricing) for more details.
</Info>

## Overview

To read blockchain data (like balances or transactions) or write to it (like deploying contracts), you need a connection to a blockchain node. **Node** provides blockchain access for developers building on [Base](https://base.org/), giving you instant RPC access without running your own infrastructure.

Think of it as a direct line to the Base blockchain. You make requests, and Node handles all the complexity of connecting to and querying the network.

## Key features

* **Production-ready RPC access:** Instant connection to Base Mainnet and Sepolia testnet with reliable infrastructure and fast response times
* **Generous free tier:** Get started with 10 million billing units free every month (enough for most development and testing needs)
* **Zero infrastructure management:** Skip the complexity of running your own blockchain node and just use our endpoints
* **Standard Ethereum compatibility:** Works seamlessly with any Ethereum-compatible tools and libraries like `ethers.js` and `viem`
* **Beyond basic RPC:** Includes Paymaster for gas sponsorship and wallet history methods (ready to use immediately)

## Use cases

* **Build DeFi apps:** Create trading interfaces, lending platforms, or dashboards that display live blockchain data
* **Create NFT platforms:** Build marketplaces that show who owns which NFTs and track their transfer history
* **Develop wallet apps:** Display user balances, show transaction history, and send transactions on behalf of users
* **Deploy smart contracts:** Upload your contracts to Base and interact with them programmatically

## Supported networks

Currently available on:

* **Base Mainnet** - Production environment for live applications
* **Base Sepolia** - Testnet for development and testing

Base is a secure, low-cost, builder-friendly Ethereum L2 built to bring the next billion users onchain. [Learn more about Base](https://docs.base.org/).

## Getting started

Ready to connect to Base? Our quickstart guide walks you through everything step-by-step—from trying Node in the browser playground to making your first programmatic request with code examples in multiple languages.

## Pricing & Rate Limits

CDP Node operates on a pay-as-you-go model with a generous free tier:

* **10 million Billing Units (BU) free every month**
* **After the free tier:** \$0.50 per million additional BUs
* **Rate limit:** 7,500 BU every 5 seconds per project (approximately 50 requests per second)

Each JSON-RPC method consumes a specific number of BUs based on computational complexity. The average call uses 30 BU.

**Need higher limits?** Join our [Node Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/1220414409550336183/1222183017284501535) to request a rate limit increase.

For detailed pricing by method, see our [Pricing page](/data/node/pricing).
